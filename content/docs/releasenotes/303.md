## Anchore Enterprise 3.0.3

v3.0.3 is a patch release of Anchore Enterprise containing targeted fixes and improvements. No database upgrade is necessary.

## Enterprise Service Changes

### Fixes
+ Better vulnerability listing API call performance
+ Fixes regression in 3.0.0+ that made "hints" feature cause analysis errors of images for some package types
+ Large image analysis load failures from catalog to policy engine due to connection timeout. Makes timeout configurable. 
+ Updates internal Syft to 0.15.1 to reduce java package CVE false positives and include CPE permutations that replace hyphens with underscores for better matching
+ Adds missing recent ubuntu release vulnerability feeds (20.10, 21.04)
+ Fixes Ubuntu feed mappings from name to version via configuration
+ Adds new debian releases for vulnerability feeds and makes new ones configurable without software upgrades

## Enterprise UI Changes

### Fixes
+ Adds package path to vulnerability listing table to differentiate findings packages in multiple locations
+ Report manager timezone string conversion error
+ The CSV report data for an image that is a descendant of a base image would not show the **Inherited From Base** column header in the output if the dataset contained items that were false
+ In the **Print Report** view for Vulnerabilities in Image Analysis, the appearance of the **View Report** button was obscuring the values held in the Vulnerability ID column
+ The Anchore Service Version (previously, Anchore Engine Version) in the **About Anchore Enterprise Client** modal will now update dynamically if the services are upgraded in the background
